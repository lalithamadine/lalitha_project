The Main Objective of Alumni Event Management Portal is to maintain communication between passed out students and students of university or college to know about each otherâ€™s current activities. The students can also post and read various articles, thus promoting literary insight. Articles can be seen by anybody who is registered. Based on the requests from the students, passed out students can conduct webinars on trending topics. Nowadays, it is very difficult to communicate with our seniors without knowing any details about them, and the only way is to contact college for their activities, to avoid this we are creating an app where the current students and passed out students have to register and update their details, through which we can establish a connection between them. They can have friendly environment by posting their thoughts and ideas which helps in developing their future plans.
